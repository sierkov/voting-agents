# Proposal Funding Workflow

## Overview

Here is an example workflow for the weekly proposal-funding process leveraging Voting Agents technology, maximizing the ROI for the community on the invested funds:
- A funding provider commits financial resources sufficient for multiple funding rounds, such as $200k to provide up to $20k weekly for 10 weeks ($200k = $20k * 10).
- Each week voters select their best 3 proposals out of all unfunded proposals, and the latest community-wide leaderboard of proposals is prepared.
- Out of all voters, a group of 11 randomly-selected (weighted by their ADA wallet sizes) ones are named as approvers.
- Approvers verify 11 best projects and make their decisions according to the instructions set by the community/funding provider.
- Approvers provide feedback to the approvers in the previous round based on the instructions set by the community/funding provider.
- Approvers review delivery reports of the previously funded projects based on the instructions set by the community/funding provider.
- Funding is disbursed based on the approver decisions and funding reports are published.
- Reputation of approvers and proposers is updated based on the feedback provided by the approvers.

## Actors and their goals

### Proposers

Proposers' objectives are:
1. bring in projects that can generate sufficient interest to be funded.
2. deliver on the funded project to ensure positive reputation and a higher-likelihood of being funded in future rounds.

### Approvers

Approvers' objectives are:
1. Ensure that only projects satisfying the community instructions get funded.
2. Ensure that other approvers adhere to the community instructions.
3. Verify the delivery reports of previously funded projects according to the community instructions.

### Voters

Voters' objectives are:
1. Share their preferences with the community.
2. Learn over time supporting which proposals generates more value for the community.
